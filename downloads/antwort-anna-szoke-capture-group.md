Dear Anna,

Thank you very much for reaching out to me – I really appreciate you thinking of me for this opportunity. I am very interested and would like to express my availability for the UiPath project.

Let me briefly introduce myself and my relevant qualifications:

I am an IT Consultant and Software Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience in process automation, RPA development, and software engineering. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Technical University of Clausthal.

**My UiPath & Automation expertise directly matches your requirements:**

- **UiPath Development & Consulting:** In my current role as IT Consultant at DB Regio AG, I develop and deploy automation solutions using UiPath and Python, having achieved an 80% reduction in manual effort with a target of 99% automation. I build and deploy RPA robots using UiPath Orchestrator, enabling seamless task automation across teams.
- **Prior UiPath Experience:** I also worked as a dedicated RPA Developer at DB Regio AG (2021–2022), where I developed and deployed UiPath robots to streamline business workflows and improve process accuracy and efficiency.
- **Additional Automation Tools:** Beyond UiPath, I have strong experience with KNIME Analytics, Power Automate, Python-based automation, and VBA Excel – I can automate processes of any complexity using a variety of tools and platforms.
- **Software & Web Development:** I am also a full-stack software developer with deep expertise in Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, C++, and modern frameworks (React, Next.js, Django, Spring Boot, Laravel, FastAPI, NestJS). I can develop software systems and web applications of any kind to complement automation solutions.

**Regarding the project conditions:**

- **B2B / Freelancer Status:** Freelance is exactly what I am looking for at the moment – this suits me perfectly.
- **Presence in Vienna:** Occasional travel to Vienna is absolutely no problem for me.
- **Starting Date:** I am flexible and available to start immediately or within the next month, whichever works best for the project timeline.
- **Capacity (40%, flexible):** This fits well with my current availability.
- **German Language:** I am fluent in German (as well as English and French).

I would be very happy to discuss the project details further. Please find my CV attached, and feel free to contact me at your convenience:
